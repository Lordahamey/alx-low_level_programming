Malloc is a type of automatic memory allocation system that allocates memory to positive integers and returns pointers to the assigned memory.
The "free" function is used to return the allocated memory that is no longer in use back to the operating system.
Valgrind is used to keep a track of all the memory allocated and freed ehile working with very complex data.
