Recursion 
simply put, this is a program or function that calls itself. This program helps in solving large problems by breaking them down into smaller problems and as such would require a repeatation of similar steps in order to arrive at a given solution.
We can look at this using the factorial concept.
eg. 5! = 5x4x3x2x1
=> 5! = 5x4!
=> 4! = 4x3x2x1
=> 4! = 4x3!, etc
