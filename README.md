What are nested loops and how to use them
NESTED LOOPS This is a loop withing a loop. NB: It is useful when we are dealing with more number of iterations. -> memory size usage will be reduced. How to use loop function in C? for loop in C The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. ... Next, the condition is evaluated. ... After the body of the 'for' loop executes, the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement. ... The condition is now evaluated again.

What is a function and how do you use functions
 A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function, which is main(), and all the most trivial programs can define additional functions. A function declaration tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function. A function definition in C programming consists of a function header and a function body. Here are all the parts of a function

What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
Return Type − A function may return a value. The return_type is the data type of the value the function returns. Some functions perform the desired operations without returning a value. In this case, the return_type is the keyword void.

Function Name − This is the actual name of the function. The function name and the parameter list together constitute the function signature.

Parameters − A parameter is like a placeholder. When a function is invoked, you pass a value to the parameter. This value is referred to as actual parameter or argument. The parameter list refers to the type, order, and number of the parameters of a function. Parameters are optional; that is, a function may contain no parameters.

Function Body − The function body contains a collection of statements that define what the function does.
